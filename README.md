# 🌟 Star Pyramid

A chaotic little Python script that prints all three types of **star pyramid alignments** — left, right, and center — with loops, exception handling, and some tastefully sprinkled profanity. Built to run until you rage-quit with `0`.

## 🧱 Features

- Prints **left**, **right**, and **center-aligned** pyramids.
- Handles dumb input with a classic *"invalid input"* roast.
- Demonstrates `end=""` like a goddamn legend.
- Includes a loop so you can spam pyramids until you type `0` to leave.
- Comes with some strong language and stronger vibes.

## 📜 Description

> All three star alignments — right, left, and center — in Python with exception handling, loops, and a cursed mouth.  
> Keep running until you smash that `0` and escape the pyramid matrix.
